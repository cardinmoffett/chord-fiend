 * dev.mjs - run ONE device's UI in a browser, with the mocked-Live harness.

 *   node scripts/dev.mjs <device>      (or: pnpm dev:<device>)
 *
 * The device must be in patcher/devices.mjs. With no argument, the first one in
 * the manifest is used.
 *
 * Sets DEVICE for vite.config.ts, which points the `@device` alias at
 * src/app/<device>/. Node rather than an inline env var in the npm script because
 * `DEVICE=x vite` is not portable to Windows shells, and cross-env is a
 * dependency this does not need.
