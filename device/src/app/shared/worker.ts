/**
 * worker.ts - optional compute worker (inlined into the single-file build).
 *
 * The place for anything that must not fight the UI thread: sequencers,
 * analyzers, DSP-adjacent math. Dedicated workers are also exempt from the
 * timer throttling Chromium applies to hidden pages - and a device's view is
 * often not visible.
 *
 * This hello-world worker just counts the transport ticks it is fed and posts
 * the running total back. Replace it with your own message-driven engine
 * (Live pushes time in, you push events out) and delete it if you do not need
 * a worker at all.
